### Before you start[â€‹](https://availproject.github.io/join-the-network/run-avail/full-node-setup#before-you-start) <a href="#before-you-start" id="before-you-start"></a>

The instructions below assume a Linux distribution with `apt` (Debian, for example), but you may be able to adapt them to a different distribution. It's also common for users to run nodes on a cloud server. The following list of standard hardware is a recommendation of hardware specs that your environment should have:

| Minimum      | Recommended    |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 4GB RAM      | 8GB RAM        |
| 2 core CPU   | 4 core CPU     |
| 20-40 GB SSD | 200-300 GB SSD |

ALTERNATE NETWORKS & RELEASES

All instructions below are for the **Kate testnet** network. To join a different network, you may need to download a different node version from the [node releases page](https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases) and a chain specification file for the specific network. Contact the Avail team if you have questions.
